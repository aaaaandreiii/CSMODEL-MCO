    "This project entails exploring the Labor Force Survey (LFS) dataset, which is a nationwide survey of households every quarter that captures demographic and socio-economic information in regards to the current Labor Force of the Philippines. The primary purpose of the LFS is to obtain an estimate of employment and unemployment rates in the labor market and offer a quantitative framework for the formulation of labor market policies. The information encompasses a comprehensive range of individual and household characteristics for all the socio-economic factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The database, obtained from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), contains records of a national sample of about 42,768 households (Batanes included) or 42,576 households (Batanes excluded) per round of surveys. It contains detailed data for each person in the households surveyed, namely demographic traits (age, sex, marital status), educational level, occupation, and work status. The reporting unit is the household, which in turn means that the statistics present the traits of people living in private households only and not those in institutions.\n",

    "\n",
    "The specific task we aim to address is a classification problem. In this notebook, we seek to predict whether an individual has worked in the past week(PUFC11_WORK) which is answered by a binary yes or no input, using the features provided in the LFS dataset. The target variable, PUFC11_WORK, is a binary variable indicating whether an individual has worked in the past week (Yes/No). This is a binary classification problem, where we aim to classify individuals into two groups: those who have worked and those who have not, based on their demographic and socio-economic characteristics. Thus, the goal of our models is to predict which of the two groups is a person a part of based on demographic variables, educational attainment, occupation, and household characteristics features provided by the LFS dataset. Namely, these feature columns are described as the following:"
